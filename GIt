What Is Git Merge? (with Example)
git merge takes the history of two branches and creates a new merge commit (a “third” commit that ties the two histories together). 
This preserves the full record of how the branches diverged and then rejoined.

# Start on the main branch1
git checkout main
# Merge feature branch into main
git merge your-feature-branch

✅ Advantages of git merge:

Preserves complete history
Useful for teams that want to see exactly when and how branches joined
❌ Disadvantages of git merge:

Can lead to “messy” histories with lots of merge commits
