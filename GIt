What Is Git Merge? (with Example)
git merge takes the history of two branches and creates a new merge commit (a “third” commit that ties the two histories together). 
This preserves the full record of how the branches diverged and then rejoined.

# Start on the main branch1
git checkout main
# Merge feature branch into main
git merge your-feature-branch


2)
✅ Advantages of git merge:

Preserves complete history
Useful for teams that want to see exactly when and how branches joined
❌ Disadvantages of git merge:

Can lead to “messy” histories with lots of merge commits

3)
git rebase takes the commits from one branch and replays them on top of another. 
It does not create a merge commit. Instead, it rewrites commit history so 
it looks like you developed your work directly on top of the branch you rebased onto.

# Switch to feature branch
git checkout your-feature-branch

# Rebase feature branch onto main
git rebase main
