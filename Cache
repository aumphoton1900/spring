In Spring Boot, when using Caffeine Cache, expireAfterWrite and refreshAfterWrite are two important configurations 
for managing cache expiration and refreshing. Here's a concise explanation of both:

1. expireAfterWrite
Purpose: Specifies the duration after the last write operation (creation or update) during which the cache entry remains valid. 
Once this duration passes, the entry is automatically removed.
Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where stale data should be removed entirely after a fixed time.
Example Configuration:

Java

Copy code
@Bean
public Caffeine<Object, Object> caffeineConfig() {
    return Caffeine.newBuilder()
                   .expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES); // Expires 10 minutes after write
}
2. refreshAfterWrite
Purpose: Specifies the duration after the last write operation during which the cache entry remains valid, but instead of removing the entry, 
it triggers an asynchronous refresh to update the value.
Requirement: Requires a cache loader to fetch the updated value.
Use Case: Useful when you want to ensure data freshness without removing the entry, allowing stale data to be served until the refresh completes.
Example Configuration:

Java

Copy code
@Bean
public Caffeine<Object, Object> caffeineConfig() {
    return Caffeine.newBuilder()
                   .refreshAfterWrite(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES); // Refreshes 5 minutes after write
}
Note: refreshAfterWrite works only with a LoadingCache, as it needs a loader to fetch the updated value.

Key Differences
Feature	expireAfterWrite	refreshAfterWrite
Behavior	Removes the entry after expiration.	Refreshes the entry asynchronously.
Data Availability	Data becomes unavailable after expiry.	Stale data is served until refresh completes.
Cache Loader	Not required.	Required.
Spring Boot Integration
In Spring Boot, you can configure these properties in application.yml when using Caffeine with Spring's caching abstraction:

Yaml

Copy code
spring:
  cache:
    caffeine:
      spec: expireAfterWrite=10m,refreshAfterWrite=5m
This configuration ensures that entries expire after 10 minutes and refresh
