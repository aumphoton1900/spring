@RequestScope bean request getting stored across multiple request ? how to prevent ?

In Spring, a @RequestScope bean should be created fresh for each HTTP request.
If you see it persisting across multiple requests, it usually means one of these issues is happening:

Common Causes
Not actually in a web request context

If you run code outside of an HTTP request (e.g., in a background thread, scheduler, or test without MockMvc), Spring falls back to a singleton proxy unless configured otherwise.
Improper bean injection into singleton

If a @RequestScope bean is injected directly into a singleton bean, the proxy may hold onto the same instance longer than expected.
Custom thread pools / async calls

Request scope is bound to the servlet thread. If you spawn new threads without propagating the request context, the scope won’t reset.
Session scope confusion

Accidentally using @SessionScope or caching request data in a session-scoped or singleton bean.
How to Prevent Persistence Across Requests
1. Use Scoped Proxy Correctly
Java

Copy code
@Component
@RequestScope(proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class MyRequestBean {
    private final String id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    public String getId() { return id; }
}
This ensures that when injected into a singleton, Spring uses a proxy that resolves the correct instance per request.

2. Avoid Storing Request Bean in Singleton Fields
❌ Wrong:

Java

Copy code
@Component
public class MyService {
    private final MyRequestBean bean; // Holds same proxy instance
    public MyService(MyRequestBean bean) { this.bean = bean; }
}
✅ Better:

Java

Copy code
@Component
public class MyService {
    @Autowired
    private ObjectFactory<MyRequestBean> beanFactory;

    public void process() {
        MyRequestBean bean = beanFactory.getObject(); // Fresh per request
    }
}
3. Ensure Code Runs in HTTP Request Context
If you use async:

Java

Copy code
@Async
public void asyncMethod() {
    // Request scope won't work here unless you propagate context
}
Use DelegatingSecurityContextRunnable or RequestContextHolder to propagate request attributes.

4. Check for Caching
Make sure you’re not manually caching the request-scoped bean or its data in a static field, singleton, or session.

✅ Summary:

Use proxyMode when injecting into singletons.
Don’t store request beans in long-lived objects.
Keep execution within the request thread or propagate context.
If you want, I can give you a full runnable Spring Boot example showing correct @RequestScope behavior and how to test it.
Do you want me to prepare that?

Zero-Downtime Deployments

Zero-downtime deployments ensure that applications remain available and uninterrupted during updates. This is critical for maintaining user experience and business continuity. Below are the most effective strategies to achieve zero-downtime deployments.

1. Blue-Green Deployment

This strategy involves maintaining two identical environments: Blue (current) and Green (new).

Steps:

Deploy the new version to the Green environment while the Blue environment remains live.

Test the new version in the Green environment.

Switch traffic from Blue to Green using a load balancer once testing is successful.

Rollback is simple—redirect traffic back to the Blue environment if issues arise.

Advantages: Quick rollback and minimal risk. Considerations: Requires additional infrastructure, increasing costs.

2. Canary Deployment

This approach introduces the new version incrementally to a small subset of users.

Steps:

Deploy the new version to a small percentage of servers or users.

Monitor performance and gather feedback.

Gradually increase traffic to the new version until it fully replaces the old one.

Rollback involves stopping further rollout and reverting affected users.

Advantages: Reduces risk by limiting exposure. Considerations: Requires robust monitoring systems.

3. Rolling Deployment

Updates are applied gradually across servers in batches.

Steps:

Update a subset of servers while others continue serving traffic.

Monitor updated servers before proceeding to the next batch.

Repeat until all servers are updated.

Advantages: No need for duplicate environments. Considerations: Rollback can be complex if issues arise mid-deployment.

Best Practices

Use load balancers to manage traffic during transitions.

Implement health checks to ensure only healthy instances serve traffic.

Leverage CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

Use feature toggles to control feature visibility without redeploying.

By selecting the right strategy based on your application’s needs, you can achieve seamless updates with minimal risk
