@RequestScope bean request getting stored across multiple request ? how to prevent ?

In Spring, a @RequestScope bean should be created fresh for each HTTP request.
If you see it persisting across multiple requests, it usually means one of these issues is happening:

Common Causes
Not actually in a web request context

If you run code outside of an HTTP request (e.g., in a background thread, scheduler, or test without MockMvc), Spring falls back to a singleton proxy unless configured otherwise.
Improper bean injection into singleton

If a @RequestScope bean is injected directly into a singleton bean, the proxy may hold onto the same instance longer than expected.
Custom thread pools / async calls

Request scope is bound to the servlet thread. If you spawn new threads without propagating the request context, the scope won’t reset.
Session scope confusion

Accidentally using @SessionScope or caching request data in a session-scoped or singleton bean.
How to Prevent Persistence Across Requests
1. Use Scoped Proxy Correctly
Java

Copy code
@Component
@RequestScope(proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class MyRequestBean {
    private final String id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    public String getId() { return id; }
}
This ensures that when injected into a singleton, Spring uses a proxy that resolves the correct instance per request.

2. Avoid Storing Request Bean in Singleton Fields
❌ Wrong:

Java

Copy code
@Component
public class MyService {
    private final MyRequestBean bean; // Holds same proxy instance
    public MyService(MyRequestBean bean) { this.bean = bean; }
}
✅ Better:

Java

Copy code
@Component
public class MyService {
    @Autowired
    private ObjectFactory<MyRequestBean> beanFactory;

    public void process() {
        MyRequestBean bean = beanFactory.getObject(); // Fresh per request
    }
}
3. Ensure Code Runs in HTTP Request Context
If you use async:

Java

Copy code
@Async
public void asyncMethod() {
    // Request scope won't work here unless you propagate context
}
Use DelegatingSecurityContextRunnable or RequestContextHolder to propagate request attributes.

4. Check for Caching
Make sure you’re not manually caching the request-scoped bean or its data in a static field, singleton, or session.

✅ Summary:

Use proxyMode when injecting into singletons.
Don’t store request beans in long-lived objects.
Keep execution within the request thread or propagate context.
If you want, I can give you a full runnable Spring Boot example showing correct @RequestScope behavior and how to test it.
Do you want me to prepare that?
